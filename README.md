# ü§ñ Active Directory Project  

## üìå Project Description  
This project demonstrates setting up an Active Driectory(homelab), integrating Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team to explore how a domain environment works while learning how to ingest events to a SIEM and generate telemetry related to attacks in the real-world to help detect in the future.

‚úÖ **Analyzing security logs** in Splunk.  
‚úÖ **Powershell scripting** for tasks (Set-ExecutionPolicy, Invoke-AtomicTest).
‚úÖ **Brute force attacks** using crowbar and hydra.  
‚úÖ **Simulating cyber attacks** with Atomic Red Team (ART).  
‚úÖ **Troubleshooting network** connectivity between VM machines.  

By implementing this SOAR workflow, you can **automate security operations**, reduce response time, and improve efficiency in a **SOC environment**.
